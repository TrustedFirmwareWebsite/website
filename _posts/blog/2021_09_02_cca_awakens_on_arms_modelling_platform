**Confidential Information: CCA Awakens on Arm’s Modelling Platform**
==========================================================================

I’m sure many people will, by now, be aware of Arm’s Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA). This is a key component of the Armv9-A architecture and was announced earlier this year. If you missed it, I heartily recommend taking some time to watch the excellent presentations from the Linaro Arm CCA Tech Event [1] and review the documentation on Arm’s website [2], [3]. As part of the CCA Tech Event, Arm made public a branch of the TF-A Monitor to preview the required implementation changes to support CCA [4].

Today we are announcing the next piece of the puzzle; the release by Arm of a Fixed Virtual Platform (FVP) that supports the Realm Management Extension (RME) [5]. With this, it is now possible to execute the TF-A Monitor preview code. Full instructions are available at [6] which describe how to access and build all the code, and boot and run the new RME tests on the FVP.

For now, the rme_prototype branch replaces the secure world with realm world, replacing the secure world image (BL32) with the realm world binary. A Test Realm Payload (TRP) is packaged as BL32 by default, which is used as a mock Realm Management Monitor (RMM) by the TFTF tests. BL2 is also modified to run at EL3 and load firmware images in the realm and non-secure address spaces. A common RMM Dispatcher (RMMD) is included with the monitor, which rCoutes RMI calls between non-secure and realm worlds and provides the Granule Transition Service (GTS) for migrating memory between PASs. See [7] for more details.
