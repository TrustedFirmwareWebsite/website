'm pleased to announce that OP-TEE version 3.22.0 is now available.
The list of changes can be found in the changelog [1]. The branch for
stable can be found here [2]. Tested platforms in this release can be 
found here [3].

Many thanks to everyone who has contributed in any form to this release.

Let me also highlight that because many people are on vacation over the
summer, we cancelled the Linaro OP-TEE call for the month of July.
Having said that, we have coverage for maintenance tasks and security
issues. However, due to the reduced workforce, getting attention for
reviewing and merging may take a little longer in the coming weeks.
