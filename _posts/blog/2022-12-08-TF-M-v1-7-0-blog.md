**Trusted Firmware-M: v1.7.0: New Profile, Improve Configurability and FWU API 1.0**
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) [v1.7.0](https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-M/trusted-firmware-m.git/tag/?h=TF-Mv1.7.0) was released on 8 th December 2022. The major additions in the release include new Medium-ARoT-less profile, improving configurability by introducing Kconfig and configuration header files along with the Base configuration and alignment with PSA Certified Firmware Update API 1.0.

Release Highlights 
----------

Below are the main additions in TF-Mv1.7.0:

- New Profile: In addition to Profile Small, Medium and Large Profiles, Medium-ARoT-less profiles is
available.

   Medium-ARoT-less aligns with security requirements defined in PSA Certified ARoT-less Level 2 [protection profile](https://www.psacertified.org/app/uploads/2022/10/JSADEN019-PSA_Certified_Level_2_PP_SESIP_ARoT-less_REL-01.pdf). This allows devices that donâ€™t require Application Root Of Trust (ARoT) to support Isolation Level1 and meet PSA L2 certification requirements.

   These profiles give users more options to easily build the TF-M configuration that meets their security requirements and thereby achieve PSA certification without any unnecessary memory or performance overheads.
