**Trusted Services v1.0.0-beta: Enabling PSA Certified on Cortex-A devices**
=====================================================

Introduction
------------

The Trusted Services project has made the first tagged release [v1.0.0-beta](https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TS/trusted-services.git/tag/?h=v1.0.0-beta). The release includes PSA
Certified Secure Services that can be deployed on Cortex-A devices to meet PSA Certified requirements.
The release also includes necessary build and test infrastructure and documentation content.

The project provides a framework for developing and deploying device root-of-trust services for A-
profile devices.Â The services in the project exists as [Firmware Framework-A](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0077/latest) Secure Partitions. The
Secure Partitions are managed by a Secure Partition Manager Core (SPMC) running as part of a Trusted
Operating System (e.g., [OP-TEE](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/op-tee/)) or Secure-EL2 Hypervisor (e.g., [Hafnium](https://www.trustedfirmware.org/projects/hafnium/)) within a Trusted Execution
Environment.

The release includes PSA Crypto, Storage and Attestation Secure Partitions exposing the PSA Certified
Functional APIs, the same APIs available today on Arm v8-M Cortex-M platforms via Trusted Firmware-
M. Additionally, UEFI SMM services are available through the SMM gateway Secure Partition. The
services within the Secure Partitions can be invoked by applications for secure operations.

OP-TEE in 3.17 and later releases support Secure Partition Manager Core (SPMC). Details can be found
[here](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/w/trusted-services/op-tee-spmc/). The diagram below shows Trusted Services deployment on a reference platform.
