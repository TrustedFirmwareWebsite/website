**White Paper: Trusted Firmware-M (TF-M) Intro to Physical Security**
=============================================================

Physical attacks on microcontrollers have been demonstrated by researchers in several security conferences. This paper explains some of the techniques that software developers can use to make physical attacks harder, and what feature Trusted Firmware-M provides in this area.
