## MBed TLS Technical Forum

This is an open forum conference call for anyone to participate. It is not restricted to TF members. It will operate under the guidance of the TF TSC. Invites and other traffic are via the TF-M mailing list. Attendees are welcome to propose agenda items.

Due to expected attendees from Asia, Europe and the Americas, the timeslot is challenging. We hope it's not too difficult for anyone - we continue to review the scheduling. We are approximately alternating between an Asia timezone and a US timezone call. Anyone is welcome to join either (or both) calls.
