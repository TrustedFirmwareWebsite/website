The TrustedFirmware.org community is delighted to announce the creation of the first TF-A Long Term Support (LTS) release, which will be based on the recent TF-A v2.8 release, and it is expected by February 2023.

The goal is for this first LTS to be supported for 5 years.

The effort is sustained for the first year by individual engineers from interested companies.
We are seeking for a wider engagement from the Trusted Firmware community to contribute and help supporting this initiative, in order to fulfil the long-term requirements.

Full details (technical description, branch name, LTS mailing lists) can be found at [this page](https://developer.trustedfirmware.org/w/tf_a/lts_proposal/) including the proposal as an attached document on the page.
