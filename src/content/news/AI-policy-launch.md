## Trusted Firmware has just released its "Guidance on AI-assisted contributions."

The short version: Yes, we accept them!

There are 3 key takeaways:

- Check Licenses: The AI tool's terms must be compatible with our open-source license.
- Verify Code : You are responsible for any 3rd-party code & proper attribution.
- Be Transparent : We recommend using "Co-developed-by:" in your commit message.

See the full guidance details here: https://www.trustedfirmware.org/aipolicy/

Let's build the future of firmware, responsibly. 🚀
