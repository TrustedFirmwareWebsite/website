In this presentation is a detailed progress update as we spin up this exciting community open source project - [Link to update presentation](/docs/TrustedFirmware-Update-June2018.pdf)

Trusted Firmware A (TF-A) is used widely throughout the ecosystem. It's joined by Trusted Firmware M (TF-M) reference code which supports the Arm Platform Security Architecture (PSA) program. By becoming a founding member of this project, your organization will be able to steer the strategy of the project, amongst many other benefits, including:

- Influencing which systems get into the Continuous Integration (CI) system
- Influencing which software interfaces are included as part of the integration test suite
- Adding support for your hardware IP
- Adding support for your software framework

If you would like your organization to be a founding member, please get in touch with enquiries@trustedfirmware.org for more details.
