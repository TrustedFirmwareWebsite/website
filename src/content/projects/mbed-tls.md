  **Mbed TLS implements TLS, DTLS protocols and X.509 certificate manipulation. TF-PSA-Crypto provides reference implementation of [PSA Cryptography API Specification](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ihi0086/b) by supporting the cryptographic operations via. PSA Crypto APIs. TF-PSA-Crypto also supports the [PSA Cryptoprocessor driver interface Specification](https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/TF-PSA-Crypto/blob/development/docs/proposed/psa-driver-interface.md) which defines an interface for cryptoprocessor drivers. Mbed TLS uses PSA Crypto APIs in TF-PSA-Crypto as the cryptographic API. The small code footprint makes the project suitable for embedded systems. It has many users, including TF-A, TF-M and OP-TEE.**
